# Professional Portfolio
This was the second project for my coding bootcamp. We were taking our knowledge of basic and advanced CSS to create a portfolio, which included using such things as flex, media queries, and pseudo-classes and -elements. However, due to unforeseen circumstances getting in the way - this is a work in progress for me.
